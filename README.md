# [commit](https://commit.frappe.cloud/)

Born out of a need to improve developer tooling for Frappe, "Commit" allows you to visualize your app's database schema and view all its APIs, generate documentation for the APIs, and manage your documentation through Commit Docs - improving developer productivity and security of your critical applications.


## Basic Installation

The below guide assumes that you already have a working Frappe and Bench installation. If you do not have it, then please head over to [Official Installation Guide](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation).

Go ahead and create a fresh new bench:
```bash
# Initialize a new bench
bench init commit
```

```bash
# Get the Commit app
bench get-app https://github.com/The-commit-company/commit
```

```bash
# Create a new site
bench new-site my-site.localhost
```

```bash
# Install the Commit app on the site
bench --site my-site.localhost install-app commit
```
